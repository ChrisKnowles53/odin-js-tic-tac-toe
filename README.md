Odin JS Tic Tac Toe

Utilising the last Odin tutorials on IIFE modules and factory functions, the game is created to hold as much code as possible with the IIFE module.

I have decided not to complete the bonus task of AI player mode.

With thanks to Dors Coding School video tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVE4xX-OkJo that helped me understand what was expected to complete this tutorial.
